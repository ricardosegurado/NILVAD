# NILVAD README v0.1

This repository will contain SAS (v9.2-9.4) syntax used in the European Commission-funded Framework 7 Randomised Controlled Trial for nilvadipine in mild and moderate Alzheimer's Disease (http://www.nilvad.eu).

The SAS syntax files are laid out in the sequence in which they are run, from processing of the database output files, quality control, restructuring, derived variables, and finally the primary and secondary data analysis steps.
